# SQL AI Agent

---

## Overview

This project features a **SQL AI Agent** designed to translate natural language prompts into executable SQL queries. Built with **LangChain**, powered by **Llama 3**, and leveraging **Groq** for incredibly fast inference, this agent significantly simplifies data retrieval and analysis by allowing users to interact with their database using plain English.

Simply input your question or command, and the agent will intelligently generate the corresponding SQL query.

## Features

* **Natural Language to SQL:** Converts human language questions and commands into precise SQL queries.
* **Intelligent Query Generation:** Leverages the advanced capabilities of **Llama 3** for accurate and context-aware SQL creation.
* **Fast Inference:** Utilizes **Groq's** high-performance inference engine to ensure rapid response times.
* **LangChain Integration:** Built on the **LangChain** framework for robust agent orchestration and modularity, making it easy to extend.
